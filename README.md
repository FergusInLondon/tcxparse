# 🏃 🚶‍♂️ TCX Parse

_There's currently not a great deal to see here; it's just a quick little tool to convert TCX files (i.e. from Garmin and Fitbit devices) in to something a little more "standard" - GeoJSON. This does however mean that only route data is persisted; i.e. heart rate and pace/time are lost._
